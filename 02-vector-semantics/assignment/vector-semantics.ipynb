    "Again the PPMI model works best, but all models are less efficient than before (meaning in similarity scores-real semantic similarity scores). P-value remains the same, apart from that in the Raw model, which means that it is less significant than the rest. That probably happens because semantic similarity provides more semantic information that derives from context (and a model can learn from context), whereas visual similarity is not based on context but rather on a visual representation of an object which can be more subjective from person to person. In terms of visual similarity, our models could be improved if trained using visual data, such as images."

    "From a tehoretical point of view, we assume that the most accurate representation for that is King - Man + Woman = Queen. King and man share the same characteristic, which is [+masculine] and queen and woman share the [+feminine] characteristic. King and queen share the [+royal] characteristic. So according to our way of thinking, when we subtract the value man from the king, we subtract the [+masculine] characreristic and it becomes [-masculine]. After that we add the [+feminine] characteristic with the word woman and it turns from king to queen, as these two words share a same characteristic as well. \n",
    "What makes this question a bit trickier is the lack of parenthesis that control the order of operations. For instance, \"King - Man + Woman = Queen\" may be interpreted differently than \"(King - Man) + Woman = Queen\".\n",
    "A final observation relies to the fact that if these correlations belong to different context, the interpretation will differ as well. If we study these terms diachornically (e.g., 1800 vs 2020), the semantic information varies from time to time. Thus, semantically these terms have a different weight."

    "## 5. Semantic composition and phrase similarity **[20 marks]**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we are going to look at how different semantic composition models, introduced in [2] correlate with human judgements. The file with the dataset is `mitchell_lapata_acl08.txt` included with this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the task from Discord channel:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are we trying to achieve?**  \n",
    "We want to create models, which can automatically capture differences in meaning of different phrases. These models should also be as good as we are (humans) in this task, right? Check example (1) from Mitchell/Lapata paper, it has two sentences which share the same words, but their meaning is completely different. We as humans can clearly see this difference, but how could a machine capture it?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is intuitive that in order to get a meaning of a phrase, we might combine meaning of individual words in this phrase somehow, but how? First, we represent each word with the frequency vector based on the semantic space that we built before (e.g, frequency space, ppmi space, svd space). In other words, each word's meaning is represented by the number of times other words occur in the context, defined by window size. Now, we have a vector for `discussion` and a vector for `thrive`. How do we combine these vectors to get a single vector for the phrase `discussion thrive`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Such methods of combining meaning vectors into a single item are called semantic composition methods (literally, because we compose semantic meaning of the phrase from its individuals). During the lecture, we tried different semantic composition methods: additive, multiplicative, combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we multiplied the vectors (went with the multiplicative method) and now we have one vector for our phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, we want to have a model that captures differences between the phrases; it means that if `discussion thrive` is our reference phrase, we need to get a different phrase to compare it with the reference one. How do we get this other phrase? Well, this other phrase can be either very similar to the reference or not similar at all, right? Let's say we decided to go with the second option and made/constructed a phrase `discussion digress`, which we know is very dissimilar to the reference phrase. We label this pair of phrases as having a low similarity, e.g., `low` in `hilo`. We can also create a different phrase (e.g., `discussion develop`) and use it as a high similarity phrase when paired with our reference phrase, right? This then would be labeled as `high` in `hilo`. This is what `hilo` in the dataset stands for: known information about how similar the reference phrase and the landmark phrase are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, our main task is to automatically learn the similarities/differences between our reference and our landmark, right? We take the first pair: `discussion thrive` vs. `discussion digress`. We have a vector representation for each of these phrases. How do we compare them? We use cosine similarity to calculate a single score that would tell us about the similarity between these two vectors. The bigger the cosine, the more similar two vectors are. Cosine ranges from 0 to 1 (0 is very low similarity, 1 is very high similarity). Let's say, we get a cosine of 0.89, it means that our multiplicative model (remember, we decided to use multiplicative semantic composition method) thinks that these phrases are very similar (cosine is quite high). But wait a second, we know that these two phrases should be of low similarity, right? Because this is what the value in `hilo` tells us about this pair - `discussion thrive` and `discussion digress` are not similar to each other. Clearly, our multiplicative method fails to capture it. What can we do to improve our model? We can try a different composition method for getting a phrase vector from phrase's words: let's replace multiplication with addition. Or we can also use combined method. Let's say we used combined method and run cosine again; this time it tells that the cosine score is 0.45. Ok, this seems to be quite low, and it also agrees with our knowledge that these phrases are indeed not similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we need to evaluate different composition models (additive, multiplicative, combined, other methods from [2]) and analyse how well they perform. How do we analyse their performance? Because we have the ground-truth for comparison (`hilo` values), we know whether our phrases are actually similar or not. We want our cosine score to reflect this knowledge: if the score is high, but the groun-truth hilo is low, then we have a problem in the model - it did not learn things well, we need to replace the composition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Long story short_: `hilo` is something that we compare our cosine to. `hilo` contains correct answers about similarity between phrases, and cosine should agree with this. If reference-landmark pair are `high` in `hilo`, then cosine should be high enough to reflecet that. If cosine is not high in this case, then we look at our model and change the composition function. We need to find the function, which give us cosines that are super close to the ground-truth known `hilo` values."

    "Now, how do we compute something similar to the results from [2] (picture above):\n",
    "\n",
    "In `High` and `Low` column you have mean cosine values.\n",
    "These are calculated by basically averaging cosine scores for all pairs of phrases per model.\n",
    "Rows introduce different models: `add` is additive, `multiply` is multiplicative, etc. (these are all described in the paper). `NonComp` is a baseline model, the most \"stupid\" one, it should be the worst. `UpperBound` is how humans performed in this task (they were asked to rate similarity between pairs of phrases, 1 is the lowest, 7 is the highest). Why these numbers are in a different scale, not from 0 to 1 like cosine, but from 1 to 7? Because they are not normalised, and authors explicitly said that they are interested in relative differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need models which are closer to human ratings. `Add` model has 0.59 mean for `High` and 0.59 for `Low`, so it did not learn to differentiate between high similarity pairs and low similarity ones. This is a bad model then, we need a better one. `WeightAdd` seems to be doing better, the difference between `High` and `Low` is now 0.01, but it's also quite bad - the difference is not that obvious. The best models are `Multiply` and `Combined`, because their mean cosines for `High` and `Low` are quite different from each other. We can see that these two models gave higher cosines for high similarity pairs (0.42 and 0.38), while giving lower cosines for low similarity pairs (0.28 and 0.28). And this is a good result - it shows that these two composition functions are so far the best in (i) giving high cosine go highly similar pairs and low cosine to very dissimilar pairs, and (ii) keeping the distance (range) between high and low cosines quite large. However, we can't say how far/close they are when compared to human performance (UpperBound) since human scores are not normalised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, we want to choose a model which is the closest to humans. This is why we are using the correlation test.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we perform the correlation test? We need to see how well *each model* correlated with human judgements. So for each model, we would have a vector of cosine values this models gives for each pair that we have. For example, let's say we have three pairs of phrases and our cosine values from additive model are the following ones: `[0.89, 0.40, 0.70]`. Now we need to get a vector of the same size, but for human scores. What do we have for human scores? We have multiple participants, which means that a single phrase can be evaluated by multiple participants. Let's say, the first phrase has scores from two participants (`6, 7`), so what we would do is that we would average it to have a single number (`(6 + 7) / 2 = 6.5`). With this, we can get a mean vector of human scores per item: `[6.5, 3, 6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have two vectors and we can runk Spearman correlation on these vectors. This is what exactly what the third column in the Results table is showing (the correlation value). There is also a p-value (denoted right below the table)."

As your semantic space, you can use pretrained spaces (standard space, ppmi or svd) introduced above.

    "1) In the \"mitchell_lapata_acl08.txt\", there are phrases in which the \"hilo\" does not correspond to the input rate (e.g., participant20 erupt fountain burst 1 high). If this is a mistake, it may affect the final average when calculating human judgement.\n",
    "2) In paper [2], they concluded that the most efficient weighting constants for the chosen parameters are 0.95 for beta, 0.05 for theta and 0.0 for alpha. However, when we used these weights in our experiment, the rho value for the combined model was 0.3813, making this model the worst of all. It seems that when beta is set to 0.7 and theta to 0.3, the best results are achieve (see above), making the combined our best model for semantic correlation. "
