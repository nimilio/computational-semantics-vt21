Let's say though that we trained a model with a baseline less than 55% or around 50%. Also, in order to be able to make a fair comparison, we should consider that we use not only the same dataset, but also the same test set. If the accuracy is too high, maybe this is an overfitting result, but this is not our case. If instead the accuracy is too low, then underfitting is clear. A low accuracy means that our model cannot perform correct predictions, so probably it sees less information in the training process. A 50% accuracy means that half of our data in the test set is predicted correctly, which could clearly be just a matter of luck, so we do not think that even the 55% is actually a good accuracy.\n",

The accuracy changed everytime we re-trained the model, from a range of 0.2 to 0.8, which is wide, so we tried to maintain an average for the analysis."
